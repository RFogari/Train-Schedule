# Train-Schedule
The objective of this assignment was to create a train schedule using Javascript and Firebase. The train schedule table displays in real time the data entered from the user form.  The data is pulled from a Firebase database linked to the site.  The user has the option to enter a train name, destination, how often the train runs, and when the time for the initial train route run.
